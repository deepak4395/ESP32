# ESP32
All basic codes for accessing or integrating different peripherals with various sensors and actuators. All codes well commented for easier understanding and reference to all libraries used is also mentioned in code itself. Enable debugging over serial port by uncommenting line #define debug. Thanks any feedback is appreciated.
